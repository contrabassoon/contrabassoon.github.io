        <h2>Teaching Double Reeds</h2>
        <p>Double reed instruments are instruments that produce sound using two reeds that vibrate against each other. This website focuses on the Western double reeds, namely oboe, English horn, bassoon, and contrabassoon in a school setting as well as how to run a double reed ensemble.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Double reeds are very expensive instruments, costing several thousand dollars at least. In addition to this, reeds are expensive both to buy and make, and they are very finnicky. It is very important for players to have good quality reeds, otherwise they will develop bad habits and won't have a chance at a good sound.</p>

        <h3>Reeds and Instrument Maintenance</h3>
        <p>The best way to handle reeds and checking up on instruments is to have a local oboist and bassoonist playtest the instruments and to have students buy handmade reeds from them. Ideally, also have students take lessons from them Store bought reeds are rarely any good, and even handmade reeds can suffer during shipping. Oboists will usually be able to handle basic maintenance of their instruments, but bassoonist, having less access points for adjustment, will not be able to. Even though they will not always be able to solve issues with instruments, they can identify them better than a non-double reed player could.</p>
        <p>Students wanting to learn how to make reeds will need the following tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>oboe/bassoon plaque</li>
            <li>oboe/bassoon mandrel</li>
            <li>reed knife</li>
            <li>cutting block or reed guillotine</li>
            <li>FF nylon thread</li>
            <li>gouged, shaped, and folded oboe cane (oboes only)</li>
            <li>gouged, shaped, and profiled bassoon cane (bassoons only)</li>
            <li>wire (bassoons only)</li>
            <li>duco cement (bassoons only)</li>
            <li>other items, as recommended by private teacher</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arranging</h3>
        <p>Since double reed ensembles are not standard ensembles, there is not much music suited for them. However, the wide range of notes available makes them very flexible for arrangements. Below are the instrument ranges (in written pitch, English horn sounds a perfect fifth lower and contrabassoon sounds an octave lower than written):</p>
