        <h2>Teaching Double Reeds</h2>
        <p>Double reed instruments are instruments that produce sound using two reeds that vibrate against each other. This website focuses on the Western double reeds, namely oboe, English horn, bassoon, and contrabassoon in a school setting as well as how to run a double reed ensemble.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Double reeds are very expensive instruments, costing several thousand dollars at least. In addition to this, reeds are expensive both to buy and make, and they are very finnicky. It is very important for players to have good quality reeds, otherwise they will develop bad habits and won't have a chance at a good sound.</p>
